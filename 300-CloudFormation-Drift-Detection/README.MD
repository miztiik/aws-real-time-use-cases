# Configuration Drift Detection

## Scenario

You have provisionsed multiple resources in AWS using cloudformation(Cft) templates. Everything works fine, After a few days you notice that one of the configurations is no longer as it should be. You have confirmed that the Cft templates are correct. What control mechanism you recommend to identify such drifts in configuration and notify stack owners. You also have to ensure the solution should be reusable across environments and regions.
