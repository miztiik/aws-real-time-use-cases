# DynamoDB - Automatic Notification Triggers based on Event Time

## Scenario

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Your DynamoDB has lot of items. One of the attribute for the items can have a value of `NEW` or `PROCESSED`. All new items are written with value of `NEW`. During the day, other business services process the item and change the status to `PROCESSED`. Occasionally few items gets missed or does not get processed within 24 hours.

Your client expect a daily clean up mechanism, which will process or trigger the processing engine(_say SNS notification_) only for the items with status `NEW` and older than `24 Hours`. This activity will have to be done everyday and cost effectively
